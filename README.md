# code-refactor
This is a static website to demonstrate refactoring for accessiblity.

The HTML has been substantially changed from the original to use semantic elements, follow a logical structure, and alt attributes were added to all image tags.

The CSS has comments, is consolidated, and follows the logical structure of the HTML.

You can find a link to the published website [here.](https://brouiller.github.io/code-refactor/)
